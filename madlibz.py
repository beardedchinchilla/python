learning I am if this new Padawan is ready to be a/an %r
jedi. %r has shown talent with the Force, but 
%r, he/she seems to be lacking. a jedi worrior
should not forget where they leave their %r
lightsaber, no matter how %r they were training
the night before. %r was not able to use the
%r to lift an X-wing %r out of the
%r yesterday, even when i said to %r
harder. and being dropped into the swampy %r
i do not like, when a padawan forgets to fasten the buckles on his/her
%r before doing backflips. the force tells me there
is another %r, but take my chances with that one,
i think i will not!
